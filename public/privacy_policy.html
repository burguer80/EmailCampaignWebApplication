Mensajeroexpress.com Privacy Policy




<hr />



<div id="page">

	<!-- start content -->
	We take your privacy, and the privacy of your subscribers, very seriously at Mensajeroexpress.com.<br> If you have any questions about our privacy policy, contact us.
A. Our Pledge to You
<ul>
<li>1. When you sign up, you will not be automatically subscribed to any promotional emails.</li>
<li>2. Your personal information (and your customer information) will be kept strictly confidential. It is never sold, given away, or shared with anyone, unless we're required to by law.</li>
<li>3. We do not send promotional messages to you unless you explicitly request to receive them.
</li>
<li>4. We may send you automated emails asking you if you'd like to activate, or de-activate your free trial (if you don't use it after a reasonable time period). We like to remove dormant accounts from our system, to keep our database clean.
</li>
<li>5. In order to use Mensajeroexpress.com, you must first complete the "Free Trial" registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to send you a confirmation link, which is used to activate your account. You have the option to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender) to us; we encourage you to submit this information so we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. 
</li>
</ul>

  
   



B. Collection and Distribution of Information in Aggregate Formats
<ul>
<li>1. We also collect information concerning non-personal email marketing stats from our customers' campaigns (such as open-rates, click-rates, bounce-rates, and ROI), and assemble reports that you, and other customers, can use to compare your performance against others in and/or outside your and their industries. No personally identifiable information is provided with these reports.
</li>
<li>2. Likewise, we reserve the right to collect and disclose any other information relating to the use of our website to any third party provided we do not disclose information in a form that can be linked to a particular customer. 
</li>
</ul>



C. Breach of Security Policy
<ul>
<li>1. Nobody is safe from hackers these days. Mensajeroexpress.com will notify you as soon as possible if a breach in security results in an unauthorized intrusion into our system which directly or materially affects you or your subscribers, and will subsequently report the corrective action taken in response to the intrusion.
</li>
<li>2. It should be noted however, that when you send a campaign, it bounces around the Internet from server to server, and can theoretically be read by prying eyes and nosy techies and government officials. We have no control over the security and privacy of your emails and subscribers after you hit the "Send" button from Mensajeroexpress.com. So if you're sending extremely private information to your recipients, and require absolute secrecy, email is not the way to go. 
</li>
</ul>
